  dataset: American Community Survey Table DP02, Selected Social Characteristics 
  datayear: Not recorded
  notes:
    - note: Ancestry listed in this table refers to the total number of people who responded with a particular ancestry; for example, the estimate given for Russian represents the number of people who listed Russian as either their first or second ancestry. This table lists only the largest ancestry groups; see the Detailed Tables for more categories. Race and Hispanic origin groups are not included in this table because official data for those groups come from the Race and Hispanic origin questions rather than the ancestry question (see Demographic Table).
    - note: Data for year of entry of the native population reflect the year of entry into the U.S. by people who were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island Areas or born outside the U.S. to a U.S. citizen parent and who subsequently moved to the U.S.
    - note: "Methodological changes to citizenship edits may have affected citizenship data for those born in American Samoa. Users should be aware of these changes when using 2018 data or multi-year data containing data from 2018. For more information, see:  American Samoa Citizenship User Note."
    - note: The Census Bureau introduced a new set of disability questions in the 2008 ACS questionnaire. Accordingly, comparisons of disability data from 2008 or later with data from prior years are not recommended. For more information on these questions and their evaluation in the 2006 ACS Content Test, see the Evaluation Report Covering Disability.
    - note: 'Data about computer and Internet use were collected by asking respondents to select "Yes" or "No" to each type of computer and each type of Internet subscription. Therefore, respondents were able to select more than one type of computer and more than one type of Internet subscription.'
    - note: 'The category "with a broadband Internet subscription" refers to those who said "Yes" to at least one of the following types of Internet subscriptions: Broadband such as cable, fiber optic, or DSL; a cellular data plan; satellite; or a fixed wireless subscription.'
    - note: 'An Internet "subscription" refers to a type of service that someone pays for to access the Internet such as a cellular data plan, broadband such as cable, fiber optic or DSL, or other type of service. This will normally refer to a service that someone is billed for directly for Internet alone or sometimes as part of a bundle.'
    - note: '"With a computer" includes those who said "Yes" to at least one of the following types of computers: Desktop or laptop; smartphone; tablet or other portable wireless computer; or some other type of computer.'
    - note: Caution should be used when comparing data for computer and Internet use before and after 2016. Changes in 2016 to the questions involving the wording as well as the response options resulted in changed response patterns in the data. Most noticeable are increases in overall computer ownership or use, the total of Internet subscriptions, satellite subscriptions, and cellular data plans for a smartphone or other mobile device. For more detailed information about these changes, see the 2016 American Community Survey Content Test Report for Computer and Internet Use located at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/content-test.htm or the user note regarding changes in the 2016 questions located at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes.html .

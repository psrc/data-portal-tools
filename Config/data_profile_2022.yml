    - expl: An "-" entry indicates that the estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. For a 5-year median estimate, the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median itself.
    - expl: An "N" entry in the estimate and margin of error columns indicates that data for this geographic area cannot be displayed because the number of sample cases is too small.
    - expl: An "(X)" means that the estimate or margin of error is not applicable or not available.
    - expl: A "median-" indicates that the median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example "2,500-").
    - expl: A "median+" indicates that The median falls in the highest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example "250,000+").
    - expl: An "**" entry in the margin of error column indicates that the margin of error could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations.
    - expl: An "***" entry in the margin of error column indicates that the margin of error could not be computed because the median falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution
    - expl: An "*****" entry in the margin of error column indicates that A margin of error is not appropriate because the corresponding estimate is controlled to an independent population or housing estimate. Effectively, the corresponding estimate has no sampling error and the margin of error may be treated as zero.
  notes_applicable_to_all_census_data_profiles:
    - note: Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureaus Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.
    - note: Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see Accuracy of the Data). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.
    - note: While the American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the July 2015 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, in certain instances the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineations due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.
    - note: Estimates of urban and rural population, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2020 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS may not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.
    - note: Supporting documentation on code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing can be found on the American Community Survey website in the Technical Documentation section.
    - note: Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the Methodology section.

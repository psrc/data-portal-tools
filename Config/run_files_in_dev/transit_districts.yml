      data_lineage: 'Transit agencies, except ferry agencies, send information on
        their service district boundaries, as needed to PSRC. Transit districts are
        determined by Public Transit Benefit Areas (PTBAs are granted the authority
        to impose a voter-authorized sales tax), City/County boundaries, and other
        service areas.  The majority of transit systems in the region are operated
        by PTBAs, with the exception of King County Metro and Sound Transit (a regional
        transit authority). '

      assessment: There are a number of lots that are reported by multiple agencies
        - often with slightly different capacity and/or utilization numbers depending
        on the date of the count. The datasets from King County Metro and Sound Transit
        include the most overlap. When there are overlapping lots, the counts are
        updated based on the values provided by King County, Kitsap, Pierce, and Community
        before Sound Transit is considered.

      data_lineage: The park and ride capacity and occupancy data are supplied by
        each of the transit agencies. The collection and reporting system varies by
        agency. Community Transit provides annual counts for capacity and utilized
        parking spaces. King County Metro Transit provides annual capacity counts
        and monthly averages for the number of utilized parking spaces. Kitsap Transit
        provides counts for the capacity and utilized spaces at inconsistent intervals
        (ranging 1-5 times a month), as well as annual averages. Pierce Transit provides
        annual capacity counts and monthly, quarterly, and yearly averages for the
        number of utilized parking spaces. Sound Transit provides monthly counts for
        capacity and utilized parking spaces.

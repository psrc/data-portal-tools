      assessment: 'Since the release of the Census 2000 versions of the TIGER/Line
        files, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped most linear features, including
        those that form legal or statistical area boundaries.

        The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that
        are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the
        U.S. Census Bureau`s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic
        Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents
        a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however,
        each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set,
        or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.'

      data_lineage: 'Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by visible
        features (e.g., streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks), and by non-visible
        boundaries (e.g., city, town, township, county limits, and short line-of-sight
        extensions of streets and roads). Generally, census blocks are small in area
        (e.g., a block in a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be
        large, irregular and bounded by a variety of features (e.g., roads, streams,
        and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks may
        encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in the
        United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks are the smallest
        geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial
        census. A block may consist of one or more faces.

        Blocks never cross county or census tract boundaries. They do not cross the
        boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, including
        American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas, congressional districts,
        county subdivisions, places, state legislative districts, urbanized areas,
        urban clusters, school districts, voting districts, or ZIP Code Tabulation
        Areas (ZCTAs) or some special administrative areas such as military installations,
        and national parks and monuments.

        Census 2020 blocks are numbered uniquely within the 2020 boundaries of each
        state/county/census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first
        character of the tabulation block number identifies the block group.'

      supplemental_info: 'Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units,
        and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census
        2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not
        necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.

        The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles is for statistical data
        collection and tabulation purposes only. Their depiction and designation for
        statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional
        authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land
        descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal
        places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.

        A block number can only be unique by using the decennial census state, county,
        census tract, and block or STATEFP20 + COUNTYFP20 + TRACTCE20 + BLOCKCE20.
        There is no consistency in block numbers from census to census.

        A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used
        geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other
        census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints,
        along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As
        a result, all 2020 Census blocks nest within every other 2020 Census geographic
        area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block
        level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.'

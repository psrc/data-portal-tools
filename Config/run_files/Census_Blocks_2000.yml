      data_lineage: 'Census blocks, the smallest geographic area for which the Bureau of 
        the Census collects and tabulates decennial census data, are formed by streets, 
        roads, railroads, streams and other bodies of water, other visible physical and 
        cultural features, and the legal boundaries shown on Census Bureau maps.
      
        Census 2000 blocks are numbered uniquely within the 2010 boundaries of each
        state/county/census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first
        character of the tabulation block number identifies the block group.'

      supplemental_info: 'The 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally
        reflect the September 2018 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations
        of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances,
        the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables
        may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective
        dates of the geographic entities.

        The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles is for statistical data
        collection and tabulation purposes only. Their depiction and designation for
        statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional
        authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land
        descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal
        places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.

        A block number can only be unique by using the decennial census state, county,
        census tract, and block or STATEFP00 + COUNTYFP00 + TRACTCE00 + BLOCKCE10.
        There is no consistency in block numbers from census to census.

        A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used
        geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other
        census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints,
        along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As
        a result, all 2000 Census blocks nest within every other 2000 Census geographic
        area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block
        level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.'

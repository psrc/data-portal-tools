      assessment: 'Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability.
        The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability
        is represented through the use of a margin of error (MOE). The value shown
        here is the 90% MOE. The MOE can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90%
        probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the MOE and the
        estimate plus the MOE (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the
        true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject
        to nonsampling error (Accuracy of the Data: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/accuracy/ACS_Accuracy_of_Data_2019.pdf).
        The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.'

        the U.S. Census Bureau. It uses a series of monthly samples to produce annually

      description: 'This dataset contains ACS 1y estimates for selected demographic
        and housing estimates for the population. Topics include sex and age, race,
        Hispanic origin, housing units, etc. The data are available at a range of
        geographic levels in Washington and within the 4-county PSRC region (King,
        Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties): state, county, MSA (metropolitan
        statistical area), and city with population of 65,000+.

        micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and
        boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the
        OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic
        entities.

        Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics
        reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a
        result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect
        the results of ongoing urbanization.'

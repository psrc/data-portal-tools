      assessment: 'Since the release of the Census 2000 versions of the TIGER/Line
        files, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped most linear features, including
        those that form legal or statistical area boundaries.

        The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles is for statistical data
        collection and tabulation purposes only. Their depiction and designation for
        statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional
        authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land
        descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal
        places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.'

      data_lineage: 'Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200
        and 8,000 people with an optimum size of 4,000 people. The spatial size of
        census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Ideally,
        census tract boundaries remain stable over time to facilitate statistical
        comparisons from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns
        caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require
        boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due
        to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.

        Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
        They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated
        place boundaries in some states to allow for census tract-to-governmental
        unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged
        between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries
        in the standard census geographic hierarchy.

        In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.
        These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive
        with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. '

      supplemental_info: The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database
        files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
        from the U.S. Census Bureau`s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
        Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB
        represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts,
        however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent
        data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.

      use_constraints: 'Since the release of the Census 2000 versions of the TIGER/Line
        files, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped most linear features, including
        those that form legal or statistical area boundaries.

        The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles is for statistical data
        collection and tabulation purposes only. Their depiction and designation for
        statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional
        authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land
        descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal
        places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.'

      summary: "Census tracts are small, relatively permanent geographic entities within counties (or the statistical equivalents of counties) delineated by a committee of local data users. Generally, census tracts have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents and boundaries that follow visible features. When first established, census tracts are to be as homogeneous as possible with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions."

      supplemental_info: The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database
        files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information
        from the U.S. Census Bureau`s Master Address File / Topologically Integrated
        Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB
        represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts,
        however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent
        data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.

      data_lineage: The Census Bureau defines PUMAs for the tabulation and dissemination
        of decennial census and American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata
        Sample (PUMS) data. Additionally, the ACS and Puerto Rico Community Survey
        use them to disseminate their respective period estimates.

      summary: 'Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are non-overlapping, statistical
        geographic areas that partition each state or equivalent entity into geographic
        areas containing no fewer than 100,000 people each. They cover the entirety
        of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. '

      supplemental_info: "The delineation of new PUMAs occurs after the completion\
        \ of the decennial census as part of a program involving the State Data Centers\
        \ (SDCs). Decennial census population counts and updated census tracts are\
        \ critical inputs into the delineation process.\nEach microdata file is a\
        \ stratified sample of the population which was created by subsampling the\
        \ full census sample (approximately 15.8 percent of all housing units) that\
        \ received census longform questionnaires. Initial sampling was done address-by-address\
        \ in order to allow the study of family relationships and housing unit characteristics\
        \ for occupied and vacant units. Sampling of people in institutions and other\
        \ group quarters was done on a person-by-person basis.\nThere are two independently\
        \ drawn samples, designated \u2018\u20185 percent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018\
        1 percent,\u2019\u2019 each featuring a different geographic scheme. Nationwide,\
        \ the Census 2000 5-percent sample provides the user records for over 14 million\
        \ people and over 5 million housing units. For the 1-percentsample, there\
        \ are records for over 2.8 million people and over 1 million housing units. "

    accessInformation: 'Census blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides by
      visible features (e.g., streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks), and by
      non-visible boundaries (e.g., city, town, township, county limits, and short
      line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads). Generally, census blocks are
      small in area (e.g., a block in a city). Census blocks in suburban and rural
      areas may be large, irregular and bounded by a variety of features (e.g., roads,
      streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way). In remote areas, census blocks
      may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory in
      the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks are the smallest
      geographic areas for which the Census Bureau publishes data from the decennial
      census. A block may consist of one or more faces.

      Blocks never cross county or census tract boundaries. They do not cross the
      boundaries of any entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, including
      American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas, congressional districts,
      county subdivisions, places, state legislative districts, urbanized areas, urban
      clusters, school districts, voting districts, or ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)
      or some special administrative areas such as military installations, and national
      parks and monuments.

      Census 2010 blocks are numbered uniquely within the 2010 boundaries of each
      state/county/census tract with a 4-character census block number. The first
      character of the tabulation block number identifies the block group.'

      assessment: 'Since the release of the Census 2000 versions of the TIGER/Line
        files, the Census Bureau has shifted and reshaped most linear features, including
        those that form legal or statistical area boundaries.

        The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles is for statistical data
        collection and tabulation purposes only. Their depiction and designation for
        statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional
        authority or rights of ownership or entitlement and they are not legal land
        descriptions. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal
        places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
        the six decimal places suggest.

        A block number can only be unique by using the decennial census state, county,
        census tract, and block or STATEFP10 + COUNTYFP10 + TRACTCE10 + BLOCKCE10.
        There is no consistency in block numbers from census to census.

        A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used
        geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other
        census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints,
        along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks.  As
        a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic
        area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block
        level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.'

        Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB
        represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts,
        however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent
        data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.
